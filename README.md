# Getting Started with TypeScript ðŸš€  

Welcome to **TypeScript**! If you're looking to add type safety, better tooling, and improved maintainability to your JavaScript projects, you've come to the right place. This guide will help you set up TypeScript and write your first program.  

## What is TypeScript?  
TypeScript is a **superset of JavaScript** that adds static types. It helps catch errors early, improves code readability, and makes refactoring easier. It compiles down to plain JavaScript, so it runs anywhere JS does.  

## Prerequisites  
Before we start, make sure you have:  
- **Node.js** installed (Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/))  
- A code editor like **VS Code** (recommended)
  
## Documentation
Refer https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/

## Installation  
To install TypeScript globally, run:  

```sh
npm install -g typescript
